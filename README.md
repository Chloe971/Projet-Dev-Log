## Fourier Transform Drawing

# Description
The aim of this project is to create a Python module that is able to draw an animation of any image, using Fourier series.
This is inspired by the [Fourier series circle drawings video by 3Blue1Brown](https://youtu.be/r6sGWTCMz2k?t=1000).

A particular interest on the parameters (degrees of approximation), speed of the videos would be of interest. 
Test and analysis on various images should be investigated. 
As a simple case, one would start with the constraint that the input image can be a black and white svg file. 
Then, adaptation to color cases and to general image format (like png, jpg, etc. ) could be added.

# Timing :

- Mid-term project snapshot: Due date Week 12 (before Friday March 26, 23:59). This will include the creation of a github repository (README.md, etc.), a short       description on how the work is split and a detailed work program for the project including how the task are attributed (coding).

- Due date (final project) : Week 16 (TBA). The github repository should be completed before this date (nothing pushed later will be taken into account). The oral     presentation should be recorded before Monday 19.
