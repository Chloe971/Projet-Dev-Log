## Fourier Transform Drawing

# Description
The aim of this project is to create a Python module that is able to draw an animation of any image, using Fourier series.
This is inspired by the [Fourier series circle drawings video by 3Blue1Brown](https://youtu.be/r6sGWTCMz2k?t=1000).

A particular interest on the parameters (degrees of approximation), speed of the videos would be of interest. 
Test and analysis on various images should be investigated. 
As a simple case, one would start with the constraint that the input image can be a black and white svg file. 
Then, adaptation to color cases and to general image format (like png, jpg, etc. ) could be added.
