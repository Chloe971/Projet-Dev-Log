### Software development project

# Fourier transform

Inspired by the video :https://youtu.be/r6sGWTCMz2k?t=1000, 

create a package that can reproduce a similar video. A particular interest on the parameters (degrees of approximation), speed of the videos would be of interest. Test and analysis on various images should be investigated. As a simple case, one would start with the constraint that the input image can be a black and white svg file. Then, adaptation to color cases and to general image format (like png, jpg, etc. ) could be added.
