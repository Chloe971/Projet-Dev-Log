Coefficients of Fourier
========================

In this part, we will find the Fourier coefficients to locate approximately given points.

To do this, we have created a function class named FOURIER for our Package draw_circle_fourier

Important note on numbers order selection:
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

When there are more than 500 coefficients ask, the program takes time and the image is no longer clear.
