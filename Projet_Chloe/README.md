# My project

We divided the work into four between BURGAT Paul, KOAN Kenjy, GUILLAUMONT Pierre and me.

In this part, I will present my part of the work to you.

My part is to find the fourier coefficients to approximately locate given points.

## Fourier Series :

The idea of the Fourier series is as follows. 
Given a function f which is 2π-periodic, can it be written as a sum of elementary 2π-periodic functions ?  

So either f a function 2π-periodic, integrable on [0,2π], continues in pieces. We call exponential Fourier coefficients of f, the complex numbers defined by :
